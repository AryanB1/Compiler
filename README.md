# Custom Language Interpreter
## Features

- **Tokenization**: The provided code includes a `Lexer` class responsible for tokenizing input text. It identifies different types of tokens such as numbers, arithmetic operators, variables, boolean operators, and control keywords like "if" and "while".

- **Parsing**: The `Parser` class takes the tokens generated by the `Lexer` and constructs a syntax tree. This tree represents the structure of the input code and is used to interpret its meaning.

- **Arithmetic Expressions**: The parser can handle arithmetic expressions involving basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses.

- **Conditional Statements**: The parser supports "if" and "while" statements, allowing for the execution of code based on specified conditions.

- **Variable Assignments**: The interpreter can handle variable assignments using the "make" keyword, allowing users to store and manipulate values.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AryanB1/custom-language-interpreter.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd custom-language-interpreter`
3. Run the interpreter: `python main.py`

## Syntax

- Arithmetic expressions: `2 + 3 * 4`
- Variable assignment: `make x = 5`
- Conditional statements: 
`if condition do`
`elif another_condition do`
`else`
`while condition do`

## Examples

1. **Arithmetic Expression**:
 Input: `2 + 3 * 4`
 Output: `14`

2. **Variable Assignment**:
 Input:
`make x = 5`
`make y = x * 2`
  Output:
   `10`
