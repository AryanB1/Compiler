# Custom Language Interpreter

## Overview

This project aims to create a custom interpreter for a simple programming language. The interpreter is designed to tokenize, parse, and interpret input code written in the custom language, allowing users to execute basic arithmetic operations, handle conditional statements, and perform variable assignments.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: The provided code includes a `Lexer` class responsible for tokenizing input text. It identifies different types of tokens such as numbers, arithmetic operators, variables, boolean operators, and control keywords like "if" and "while".

- **Parsing**: The `Parser` class takes the tokens generated by the `Lexer` and constructs a syntax tree. This tree represents the structure of the input code and is used to interpret its meaning.

- **Arithmetic Expressions**: The parser can handle arithmetic expressions involving basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses.

- **Conditional Statements**: The parser supports "if" and "while" statements, allowing for the execution of code based on specified conditions.

- **Variable Assignments**: The interpreter can handle variable assignments using the "make" keyword, allowing users to store and manipulate values.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-language-interpreter.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd custom-language-interpreter`
3. Run the interpreter: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Launch the interpreter using `python main.py`.
2. Input code using the custom language syntax.
3. The interpreter will tokenize, parse, and execute the provided code.
4. The output of executed expressions and statements will be displayed.

## Custom Language Syntax

The custom language supports the following constructs:

- Arithmetic expressions: `2 + 3 * 4`
- Variable assignment: `make x = 5`
- Conditional statements: 
`if condition do`
`elif another_condition do`
`else`
`while condition do`

## Examples

1. **Arithmetic Expression**:
 Input: `2 + 3 * 4`
 Output: `14`

2. **Variable Assignment**:
 Input:
`make x = 5`
`make y = x * 2`
  Output:
   `10`
